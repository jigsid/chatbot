# Voice Assistant Integration for SmartRep AI

This document provides instructions on how to set up and use the voice assistant feature with SmartRep AI's chatbot.

## Overview

The voice assistant integration uses [Vapi.ai](https://vapi.ai) to enable voice conversations with your chatbot. Users can speak to the assistant and receive spoken responses, creating a more natural and engaging interaction experience.

## Setup Instructions

1. Go to [Vapi.ai](https://vapi.ai) and create an account
2. Once registered, navigate to your dashboard

### 2. Create a Vapi Assistant

1. In the Vapi dashboard, create a new assistant
2. Configure the assistant with appropriate settings:
   - Select a voice model (e.g., 11labs, OpenAI, etc.)
   - Configure the language model (e.g., GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
   - Set up the assistant's personality and behavior

### 3. Get Your API Keys

1. In the Vapi dashboard, go to the API Keys section
2. Create a new API key for your project

## Using the Voice Assistant

Once configured, the voice assistant will be available in your chatbot interface:

1. In the chatbot window, you'll see a phone icon button next to the send button
2. Click the phone icon to start a voice conversation
3. When the call is active, you can:
   - Speak to the assistant and it will respond with voice
   - Click the mute button to mute your microphone
   - Click the end call button to end the voice conversation

## Integration with Existing Chatbot

The voice assistant is fully integrated with your existing chatbot:

- Voice conversations appear in the chat history
- Context from text conversations is maintained in voice conversations
- All chatbot features (appointment booking, information retrieval, etc.) are available via voice

## Webhook Configuration (Optional)

For advanced use cases, you can configure a webhook in your Vapi dashboard:

1. In the Vapi dashboard, go to Webhooks
2. Add a new webhook with the URL: `https://your-domain.com/api/vapi-webhook`
3. This enables additional features like conversation analytics and custom event handling

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the voice assistant:

1. **No sound**: Check that your browser has permission to use your microphone
2. **Assistant not responding**: Verify your API keys are correct in the settings
3. **Poor voice quality**: Try using a different voice model in your Vapi assistant settings
4. **Browser compatibility**: The voice assistant works best in Chrome, Edge, and Safari
